I'm a Brazilian marine biologist undertaking my PhD degree at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management in the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests include fisheries management, conservation of sharks and rays, habitat use, and bycatch modeling and mitigation for achieving sustainable fisheries.

I believe that we can have a sustainable relationship to marine resources with science-based measures and the support of society as a whole. My main goal is to be a part of that change and help ensure food security, sustainability for both fishers, local populations, and the exploited stocks.
