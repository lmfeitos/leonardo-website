Hello guys! 

It's been a while since I've last posted here, right?

This time I'll show you some new mapping skills I learned recently thanks to Allison Horst and Casey O'Hara!

I got data on the records of California oil spills by county in 2008 from this website https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/7464e3d6f4924b50ad06e5a553d71086_0/data and created a few data visualizations to show exactly where oil spills occurred in an interactive map. I also created a choropleth map based on the counts of oil spills per county so we can see where they most occurred in 2008.

Here are the plots!
